**📝 To-Do List**

A simple, interactive To-Do List application built using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, EJS, Node.js). This project was part of the Complete Web Development Course 2024 by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy and serves as a practical demonstration of my full-stack development skills.

🚀 Features

- EJS Templating: Dynamic and responsive user interface built with Embedded JavaScript (EJS)
- CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks
- RESTful API: Backend API with Express for handling requests and data management
- PostgreSQL Database: Efficient and reliable data storage

🛠️ Technologies Used

- Frontend: EJS (Embedded JavaScript)
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Additional: CSS for styling
